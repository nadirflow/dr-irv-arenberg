Send push notifications to iOS and Android devices when you publish a new post. Without paying fees as it does not use third-party servers.

== Description ==

Send push notifications to iOS and Android devices when you publish a new post. Straight from your WordPress site, in real-time. This plugin has a built in hub, allowing WordPress to send out the push notifications directly—**without using any third-party's server**.

> The premium [Push Notifications for WordPress](https://products.delitestudio.com/wordpress/push-notifications-for-wordpress/) also supports Safari, Web Push (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera and others) and Telegram Bot notifications. They work just like mobile notifications, but you don't need to build the apps.

Alert your visitors when new content is published, converting them to regular and loyal readers. It’s like a newsletter, but so much more effective. Keep your audience engaged.

Push Notifications for WordPress (Lite) allows you to focus on building beautiful and unique apps, without developing your own server-side back-end. Content for the apps is collected automatically from your WordPress site, so no extra work is needed to maintain them.

With Push Notifications for WordPress (Lite) you can send, for each post, a maximum of 1,000 notifications per platform (e.g. 1,000 for iOS, + 1,000 for Android).

> Push Notifications for WordPress (Lite) is our basic solution for small personal blogs. We also offer a full-featured plugin with a reduced memory footprint and unlimited notifications, [Push Notifications for WordPress](https://products.delitestudio.com/wordpress/push-notifications-for-wordpress/), designed for all the other websites. Push Notifications for WordPress also supports Safari, Web Push (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera and others) and Telegram Bot notifications.
